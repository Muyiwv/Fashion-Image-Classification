## Objective - Finding the Effects of Batch Sizes on Fashion Image Classification for E-commerce Applications

This repository contains code and resources for a research project that explores the impact of batch sizes on fashion image classification for e-commerce applications. The study aims to develop a prototype leveraging Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to automate various tasks in the e-commerce industry.

## Abstract
The rapid growth of the e-commerce industry has led to increased adoption of online platforms for retail. This study addresses the challenges faced by small business owners in emerging markets who struggle with manual content creation and management. Automated image classification techniques are essential for streamlining product listing processes. The research investigates the effect of batch sizes on the performance of AlexNet, ResNet152, and VGG16 models in fashion image recognition tasks using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The results demonstrate that varying the batch size does not significantly impact precision, recall, F1-Score, or AUC. The proposed prototype offers a foundation for improving efficiency and accuracy in e-commerce onboarding processes.

## Key Features
1. Investigates the impact of batch sizes on fashion image classification
2. Utilizes AlexNet, ResNet152, and VGG16 models
3. Evaluates performance using the Fashion MNIST dataset
4. Provides insights for efficient e-commerce onboarding processes

## Installation
